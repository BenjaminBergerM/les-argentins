            <h4>X-files is one of the best known series of all times. Even if one never watched an episode it is impossible not to be aware of Mulder, Skully and their inquest into supposed alien contacts. The series returned in 2016 after a 15 year absence and for the 11th season Fox Latin America wanted to make sure viewership was strong.
                <br><br>

                    We carried out the action simultaneously in Buenos Aires and Mexico City with the help of Gabriel Sagel of Studio Freak who produced and documented the performance during Christmas.
                    For the January 3rd season premier viewership was up 63%.
